## Front-end integration

The only step missing now is adding a search bar to your project. The easiest way of achieving this is to use [instant-meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch): a plugin that establishes communication between your Meilisearch instance and [InstantSearch](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js). InstantSearch, an open-source project developed by Algolia, is the tool that renders all the components needed to start searching.

### Let's try it!

1. Create an empty file and name it `index.html`
2. Open it in a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code
3. Copy-paste one of the code samples aboveâ€”either vanilla JavaScript, Vue 2, or Reactâ€” and save the file
4. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it in your folder

You should now have a working front-end search interface ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
